# IP-CONSOLE-03-SOC-OPS -- landing ledger

Plan: `IP-CONSOLE-03-soc-ops.md` (TRD-CONSOLE-03, SOC Operations). Created WITH the plan (2026-07-25)
per the ledger discipline: **every step's row is updated (status + commit hash) in the same session its
PR merges, and the Resume-here section is rewritten at every merge.** A stale ledger is a defect.

## Resume here (rewrite at every merge)

- **State (2026-07-26): UNBLOCKED. The crdb engine half is COMPLETE** -- `IP-SOC-SUBSTRATE` closed at
  SS.N (`761bc542`, capstone-proven in process) and `IP-SOC-VERDICT-NARRATIVE` VN.7/VN.8 landed and
  live-proven. **Next action = S3.1**, the contract: re-vendor `wire-dto.schema.json` and regenerate
  `wire-dto.ts`. Engine-first, the Objects/Policies precedent.
- **S3.8 has a missing prerequisite that is NOT in the crdb plan's roster.** `SOC_PLAN_APPROVE` /
  `SOC_PLAN_MODIFY` have no wire command: crdb SS.2 landed the response-plan record and SS.N added the
  audited `commit_plan`, but nothing outside tests calls them and no verb crosses the wire. S3.8
  cannot be built until a crdb PR adds them. Everything S3.1-S3.7 needs is live, so this blocks only
  the last build step -- but raise it before starting S3.6, since the verdict panel's two controls are
  what S3.8 wires up.
- **Two values this surface must render honestly, each proven by the crdb capstone rather than
  assumed:** `Auto-Contained` is **0** because the counter counts EXECUTION and enforcement is OFF, and
  **no lineage edge is ever `verified`** on this deployment -- an approved-but-refused containment step
  stays `pending`. Both are `INV-SOC-NO-FABRICATED-NUMBER` / `INV-SOC-EDGE-STATE-HONEST` in practice,
  not hypotheticals.
- **Most of this surface is already backed by live engine work.** `TRD-CONSOLE-03` Section 7 marks each
  element: `DETECT_SUMMARY` (FV.6, live-proven on the box 2026-07-25) carries the KPI totals, the SQ.8a
  episode working set backs the queue, LEG edges back the lineage graph, `LOG_EXPLAIN` backs the dock.
  The PENDING rows are the two crdb IPs' scope, not this one's.
- **Two lessons from the P5.N live leg are baked into the roster:** (1) S3.2 must add the encode arms in
  `@forge/wire` and prove them with a payload seam test -- the whole Policy epic was mock-only at the
  encode seam and no test caught it; (2) commands mount ABOVE the read-only 405 gate (S3.8).
- **The prototype is a framework, not a port.** Layout, hierarchy, and behavior are binding; the
  package set (React Flow, ELK, lucide) is a reference and S3.5 chooses against `DEPENDENCY-POLICY.md`.
- **Two things this surface must never do**, both encoded as invariants: upgrade an edge's state
  (`INV-SOC-EDGE-STATE-HONEST`), and fill a `PENDING` binding with a plausible number
  (`INV-SOC-NO-FABRICATED-NUMBER`). The `CONSENSUS` card is the live example -- the prototype's "5/5
  models agree" has no engine source, so Section 5.3 re-grounds it on real confidence + corroboration.

## Roster

| Step | Acceptance | Status | Commit | Note |
|------|-----------|--------|--------|------|
| S3.1 | A1 | READY | -- | the contract; crdb SS.4b + VN.7 schema regen have LANDED, this is the next action |
| S3.2 | A1, A2 | PLANNED | -- | the read path + the `@forge/wire` encode arms w/ a payload seam test |
| S3.3 | A10, A12 | PLANNED | -- | shell: command header, focus tabs, the five KPI tiles (unavailable state for PENDING bindings) |
| S3.4 | A3, A12 | PLANNED | -- | the Decision Queue, authority-first ordering as returned (no client re-sort) |
| S3.5 | A3, A4 | PLANNED | -- | the three-lane lineage graph + four distinct edge states + progressive disclosure |
| S3.6 | A5-A9, A2 | PLANNED | -- | the FORGE VERDICT panel incl. the labelled narrative and its refusal state |
| S3.7 | A3 | PLANNED | -- | the investigation dock; `Model Reasoning` shows the grounding set + skeptic adjudications |
| S3.8 | A11 | BLOCKED | -- | approve/modify commands over SS.2, above the 405 gate, confirm-gated. **Blocked on a crdb PR adding the `SOC_PLAN_APPROVE`/`SOC_PLAN_MODIFY` wire commands** -- the engine functions exist, the transport does not |
| S3.N | A1-A12 | PLANNED | -- | Playwright journeys + the live drive on the box (real incident, real gemma4 narrative) |
